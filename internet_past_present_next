# internet 3.0

Hello to all, thank you for being here. I am not an academic, nor a very good writer. What I am is a human living on earth that would like to share his point of view.

I have been involved in a project EcoNet together with many other brilliant minds and these are the minds I must thank you for a new view of computers, entities, relationships and knowledge in general.

Now, what is this about? This is about imagination, imagining how the internet could be, not only for our point of view of imagining a future, but rather by starting by looking at the past.

A past in computer science when there was science in computers. A past in computer science where the visionaries wanted to use computers to create a better world for future generations. A past were multiple aspects of human experience and knowledge were use to create this new concept of computers. 

Were to start, Alan Kay, Ted Nelson, Joe Armstrong ... (I am sure there are more but my knowledge is limited).

So now let's start to imagine.

Ted Nelson, has a very interesting view of what the web could have been, I just recently found him on youtube thanks to Tom and I watched all the videos about XanaLinks and many others.

This document is not a declaration of war, quite the opposite is a proposal for cooperation. 

We have a web with conventions, for better or worse and even though possible this conventions would be very, very difficult to change. I really see Ted's point about how one way links are very limiting and by using them humanity has not been allowed to achieve other potentials. I do see the point of reality as well, were reality is that change is difficult for most people, so even if possible resistance would be very high.

However, we are lucky, some technologies have emerged in the last years which gives as an opportunity to do things different. And not only the technologies, if computers are to touch every single aspect of earth living; (Other beings live on earth, not only humans) maybe the one's affected should be able to provide an opinion no?

The current internet and web, might be limited, abused, however it has bring some benefits, like having access to the whole human knowledge to pretty much the whole earth. 

If we look back, the software we use was created mainly in United States, a lot of it by Americans. (And there is nothing wrong with that).

But now the whole world can cooperate and there is really no excuse not to do so.

So, I said there will be a proposal for a system so let's just starting drafting it.

This are the key words. "Actor model", "Visible connection", "Arweave", "Augmented Reality", "Virtual Reality".

Browser we can not change (We can, but millions of people will resist). However with AR and VR and whatever else we choose to build, this can build with what we have learn in all this years and maybe even more important, what we have forgotten.

AR and XanaDocuments seem like a fanntastic use of the technology, even the demo's shown by Ted are 3d dimensional, so if it was conceived to be 3D, now is the time.

Arweave, I personally find arweave as the only real world, scalable, replicable use case of blockchain technology. "from their website (Here Xanalink would be great! :)" - "A new data storage blockchain protocol based on a novel proof of access consensus mechanism that creates truly permanent data storage for the first time. Now data is finally permanent, low-cost, and truly censorship free."
So everything that is uploaded to the weave becomes inmutable and gets a hash which is ID. (To me that sounds like a perfect representation of a ducument, data ... and we add Visible Connection to this inmutable hashes, we could have a distributed, non stopable, inmutable data storage for earth. 

Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, to me seem like perfect tools to visualize all this documents and their visible connections. 

So maybe, now we have an oppurtunity to build from the what we have learn and forgotten.

Maybe we can start involving earthlings, so we can design and build this new system with everybody's input.
